Trees are a dimension reduction technique

Learn OMP

Write the algorithms out!

tree feature importance

model selection: CV, CV parallel, CV stratified, CV warm started

MNIST

LP actually this should be covered.

experimental design optimization from boyd

SVD and other LA algorithms maybe another topic for this?

ADAM, SGD other algorithms

TODO learn approximation weistrass, etc terry tao?

Calculus of Variations

Sampling algorithms:
generate uniform
generate gaussian
